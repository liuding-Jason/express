# Introduction

Simple Server shows a connection of a client and a server . In general , a server must run at first , it would listen a port and run some services . When a client send a connection request , the server would response rely on the params . 

## Build Guide

Guild of "To see result" .

### Client

In this part , i hava something to say . Always remeber that you should create a ***DOMAIN*** for your client program , because a domain is needed in ***HTTP / HTTPS*** . So , you should use a http server to run your client . Here , i recommend ***anywhere*** to you . 

```bash
// install
npm install anywhere -g

//run (index.html is needed)
anywhere

``` 

### Server

In this part , my program build with ***express*** . So you show install express first . Do you kown ***supervisor*** ? Supervisor could watch your change of your javaScript files and rerun them hot and inline.


```bash
// install
npm install supervisor -g && npm install


// run 
supervisor server.js

```
